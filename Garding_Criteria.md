#    SCORING   
 0  Terrible. Nothing in this characteristic was answered sensibly. 
 1  Bad: Nearly nothing achieved. Apparently nothing was learned from the lecture or presentation round. 
 2  Not good: Very few boxes are checked. 
 3  Satisfactory. There are mistakes, some of the boxes are not checked. 
 4  Very good. No mistake have been made, all the boxes are checked. 
 5  Extraordinary. All boxes are ticked, either perfectly solved or nice/innovative ideas are added.
